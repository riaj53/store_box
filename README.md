A fast, enjoyable, and secure NoSQL database for Flutter & Dart. Store any Dart object with a simple, modern API and built-in encryption.**

`store_box` is designed to be a lightweight and powerful local database, focusing on a simple and powerful developer experience without requiring code generation.

## Why Choose `store_box`?
üöÄ Zero Boilerplate: No `build_runner`, no generated `.g.dart` files. Just write your `TypeAdapter` and you're ready to go.

üí° Simple, Modern API: The static API is intuitive and easy to learn, whether you're a beginner or an expert.

üîí Secure by Default: Built-in AES-256 encryption is easy to enable for sensitive data.

‚ù§Ô∏è Flutter First: Built for Flutter. Works everywhere Flutter does‚ÄîiOS, Android, Web, Desktop.


## Getting Started


### 1. Add to `pubspec.yaml`

Add `store_box` to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file.

```pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  store_box: ^2.0.0 
  ```


## 2. Initialize in Your App

You must initialize store_box before your app starts. This prepares the database for use and should be done once.

```dart
// main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:store_box/store_box.dart';

void main() async {
  // Required for all Flutter apps
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Initialize StoreBox. That's it!
  await StoreBox.init();

  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```
## How to Use
### 1. For Beginners:  Simple Key-Value Storage
This is the easiest way to use `store_box`. It's perfect for saving simple data like user settings, session tokens, or flags without any extra setup.

After you `init()` the package, you can immediately use the static `put()` and `get()` methods anywhere in your app.

```dart
// Save a boolean value to the default storage
await StoreBox.put('darkMode', true);

// Save a username
await StoreBox.put('username', 'Alice');

// Read the values back
final bool isDarkMode = StoreBox.get('darkMode') ?? false;
final String? user = StoreBox.get('username');

print('Dark Mode is enabled: $isDarkMode');
print('Current user: $user');

```
You can store any basic Dart type: `String`, `int`, `double`, `bool`, `List`, and `Map`.
# For Advanced Users: Storing Custom Objects

When you need to store your own data models (like a `User` or `Product class`), you need to tell store_box how to save and load them. You do this by creating a `TypeAdapter`.

## Step 1: Create Your Model and TypeAdapter
A `TypeAdapter` is an instruction manual that `store_box` uses to understand your custom object.

```// lib/user.dart
import 'package:store_box/store_box.dart';
import 'package:store_box/src/binary/binary_reader.dart';
import 'package:store_box/src/binary/binary_writer.dart';

// Your custom class
class User {
  final String name;
  final int age;
  User({required this.name, required this.age});
}

// The instruction manual for the User class
class UserAdapter extends TypeAdapter<User> {
  @override
  final int typeId = 1; // Each type needs a unique, positive ID

  @override
  User read(BinaryReader reader) {
    // Read the fields in the exact same order you wrote them
    final name = reader.read() as String;
    final age = reader.read() as int;
    return User(name: name, age: age);
  }

  @override
  void write(BinaryWriter writer, User obj) {
    // Write the fields of the object
    writer.write(obj.name);
    writer.write(obj.age);
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Register the Adapter
In your `main.dart` file, register the adapter after you initialize `StoreBox`. This should only be done once.

```dart
// main.dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await StoreBox.init();

  // Register your adapter so StoreBox knows about it
  StoreBox.registerAdapter(UserAdapter());

  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```
## Step 3: Open a Box and Use It
Now you can open a dedicated, typed "box" to store your custom objects.

```dart
// Open a box specifically for User objects
final userBox = await StoreBox.openBox<User>('users');

// Save a User object
await userBox.put('user_123', User(name: 'Alice', age: 30));

// Read the User object back
final alice = userBox.get('user_123');
print(alice?.name); // Prints "Alice"
```

## 3. Using Encryption
Protect sensitive data by providing an `encryptionKey` when you open a box. This works for both simple and custom object boxes.

```dart
import 'dart.convert';

// Key must be 32 bytes for AES-256.
// For production, use a secure key management strategy.
final encryptionKey = utf8.encode('a_very_strong_32_byte_secret_key');

final secretBox = await StoreBox.openBox(
  'secrets',
  encryptionKey: encryptionKey,
);

await secretBox.put('apiKey', '123-ABC-789');
print(secretBox.get('apiKey')); // Prints "12-ABC-789"
```
## Coming Soon!
An optional code generator package (`store_box_generator`) is in development to make working with custom objects even easier!
