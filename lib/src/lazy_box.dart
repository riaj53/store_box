/// A conceptual class for a LazyBox.
/// A LazyBox does not load all its data into memory when it is opened.
/// Instead, it reads values from the disk on-demand.
class LazyBox<V> {
  // In a full implementation, this class would have methods like `get(key)`
  // that would read a specific entry from the file instead of from an
  // in-memory map. This is essential for handling very large datasets
  // without consuming a lot of RAM.
